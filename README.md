# Contensis Sitemap Generator
Generate sitemaps for content types in Contensis


As there is no inbuilt sitemap function for _Content Types & Entries_ I have built this simple program to generate them.

It connects to your CMS using the _Delivery API_, initiates a search and builds a local XML file. 



Simple pull down and modify the project to fit your needs.

Add your content types and run the project, it will create an _.xml_ file for each in the project *bin* folder.


You can upload the XML files into contensis and add them to Google Webmaster tools, etc 

Using this as your base you could make an .exe that can be uploaded to the server to run automatically each day.
